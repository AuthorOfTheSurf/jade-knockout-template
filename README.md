# Jade (soon to be Pug.js) and Knockout.js starter template

This template aims to be a fairly minimal example of a project that uses Jade and Knockout.js in its front-end scheme. Programmers aiming to use these technologies together should be able to use this starter template as a learn-by-example opportunity.

### How to get this working

1. (Optional) Install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your `node` versioning
2. Install `node` using `nvm`
3. Install jade locally, or globally: `$ node install -g jade`
4. Use the provided script to compile the jade templates into html: `$ ./compile-jade.sh`
5. Make sure you have python 2.7 installed. Run the python server script in order to view pages locally `$ ./python-server.sh`.
6. Visit pages at `localhost:8000`
7. Take a look at source code to see how to get Jade and Knockout.js working together given a single data-blob as a starting point.
