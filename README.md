# Jade (soon to be Pug.js) and Knockout.js starter template

This template aims to be a fairly minimal example of a project that uses Jade and Knockout.js in its front-end scheme. Programmers aiming to use these technologies together should be able to use this starter template as a learn-by-example opportunity.

### Dependencies
- Node

### How to get this working

1. (Optional) Install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your `node` versioning
2. Install `node` using `nvm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start static file server & Jade/JS/Datasource watch: `npm run gulp`
5. Visit pages at `localhost:8000`. Livereload will automatically refresh the page after you save your Jade or Javascript.
6. Take a look at source code to see how to get Jade and Knockout.js working together with a structured JSON data directory as a starting point.
